**Natural Language Processing** : Integrates with OpenAI's API to provide intelligent responses to user inquiries.
**GUI Interface** : Features a modern, user-friendly interface with a background image and styled components for a Jarvis-like experience.
**Time Functionality** : Retrieve and announce the current time on request.
